## Notes

- This code is provided for learning and experimentation purposes only.



## Terms
- HRDP - Hidden Remote Desktop Protocol
    - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a protocol that allows a computer user to access another computer remotely. HRDP refers to stealthy or disguised versions of Remote Desktop Protocol.
- **HVNC** - Hidden Virtual Network Computing
  - It stands for "Hidden Virtual Network Computers" and refers to a type of remote access tool that usually operates covertly or secretly. This software allows secret access to target systems. By providing remote access to the target system, it has functions such as seeing the hidden screen, controlling mouse and keyboard inputs.
- **VNC** - Virtual Network Computing
  - Software used for remote access and control.

- **RunPE** - Run Process in Execution
  - RunPE is the part of the code responsible for injecting the functional portion of the virus into the memory of a selected process. Injection, which is placing the Payload in the memory of the chosen process, is the process itself.

  - The most commonly injected processes include:
    - svchost.exe
    - Regasm.exe
    - explorer.exe
    - Default browsers (chrome.exe, opera.exe, firefox.exe, iexplorer.exe)
    - Itself (meaning the Payload is injected into a running process)
    - vbc.exe
    - cvtres.exe

  - Explaining to beginners, Payload refers to the file you've chosen to encrypt (i.e., a virus).

- **Encryption**
  - Encryption is the algorithm responsible for 'protecting' data by converting the bytes of a selected file, rendering them unrecognizable and completely different from the original file's bytes.
- **Stub**
  - A Stub refers to a program designed to contain the encrypted file and inject it into memory upon startup.
- **Mutex**
  - A very useful feature to make sure that your file does not work more than once at the same time.
- **Melt file**
  - Deletes / Deletes a file after it has been successfully launched.
- **File Pumper**
  - Adds a certain number of bytes (with a value of 0) at the end of the file, increasing its size, but does not violate any procedures at run time.
- **USG** - Unique Stub Generator
- **WDEX** - Web Data Extraction

ETC.
